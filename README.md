# Welcome
Hello Everyone,
Welcome to securethedib.com.  This website will host resources and links created by the MSP community supporting the Defense Industrial Base.

# Join Us on Github
A discord server has been created to help with communication and to allow for discussion.  You can join the discord community by using the following link: https://discord.gg/uHq9wz4UDk.  Please note, that you will be placed into "General" which is an unmoderated channel.  Confirmed users will be added to the community "Private" channel, which is for confirmed members of the MSP community.

# Meetings
We participate in a live call twice a quarter.  Its a time for us to catch up and discuss CMMC topics dejure.  Its a great way to catch up to see what your peers are doing, and get advice on anything you may run into during your journey, and your clients' journey. Meeting invitation links are shared with confirmed members of the MSP community via email.  If you would like to participate, reach out in the "General" channel asking for confirmation.

## Future Meeting Dates
The following virtual meeting dates are tentatively scheduled:  

December 1st, 2022 @ 4PM Eastern  
January 19th, 2023 @ 4PM Eastern  
February 9th, 2023 @ 4PM Eastern  
March 18th, 2023 @ 4PM Eastern

# Contributing to the site
You can help contribute to the site by submitting pull requests to our github repository located at: https://github.com/ats-justinweeks/securethedib.com. Don't want to deal with all the technical stuff?  No worries!  Just drop good resources into the Discord, and I'm sure someone will pick it up and submit the request for you.

# Confirmed Users
Confirmed users are users who have went through a confirmation process that verifies they are part of the MSP Community or tangentially related.  This process is very light weigh, and is mostly used to combat SPAM and to send email notifications when there's information that needs to be shared with the group.  

Confirmation consists of two members of the community vouching that you are respected part of the MSP community, and for you to send an email from your assigned email address for final confirmation.

Remember that "confirmed" doesn't give you any assurance beyond what was previously stated.

# Notice to Vendors
At this time, vendors or other members of the channel that aren't directly an MSP will not be confirmed.  We value your important role in the ecosystem, but want to have an area to discuss topics without vendor influence.
